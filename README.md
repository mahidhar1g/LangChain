# LangChain Project

Welcome to the LangChain Project! This repository is organized to facilitate the development and integration of large language models (LLMs) into various applications. Below is an overview of the project's structure and the purpose of each directory.

## Agents

**Directory:** `agents/`

This directory contains modules that define various agents used in the project. Agents are responsible for interacting with LLMs to perform specific tasks, such as answering questions, generating text, or executing commands based on user input.

## Chains

**Directory:** `chains/`

The `chains/` directory includes implementations of different chains. In the context of LangChain, a chain refers to a sequence of operations or transformations applied to the input data to produce the desired output. This can involve multiple steps, such as preprocessing, model inference, and postprocessing.

## Chat Models

**Directory:** `chat_models/`

This directory houses configurations and implementations of various chat models. These models are designed to handle conversational interactions, enabling the development of chatbots or virtual assistants that can engage in dialogue with users.

## Prompt Templates

**Directory:** `prompt_templates/`

The `prompt_templates/` directory contains predefined templates for prompts used with LLMs. These templates help standardize the input format and can be customized for different tasks or models to ensure consistent and effective communication with the language models.

## RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Directory:** `rags/`

This directory focuses on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. RAG combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the quality and relevance of the generated content by incorporating external information during the generation process.

## Requirements

**File:** `requirements.txt`

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project. It ensures that all necessary packages are installed with the correct versions to maintain compatibility and functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the LangChain Project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahidhar1g/LangChain.git
cd LangChain
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment and install requirements

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment variables

```bash
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_firebase_api_key"
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
```
