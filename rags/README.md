# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAGs)

## Definition

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAGs) is a method that combines LLMs with a retrieval system. This system can search through vast sources of external information—such as documents, databases, or knowledge bases—whenever the LLM requires additional knowledge.

The process ensures that the LLM is not overwhelmed by large prompts while still providing comprehensive and accurate responses.

## What Problem Do RAGs Solve?

RAGs provide Language Learning Models (LLMs) with additional knowledge by connecting them to external sources of information. This allows the models to generate better and more accurate answers to user prompts.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you're working at a company with hundreds of internal documents (e.g., policy guidelines, technical specifications, customer support documents, etc.). If you have a question, you would typically need to search through each file manually.

With RAGs, this process is streamlined. You can ask your question in plain English, and the LLM retrieves the most relevant information from those documents, providing an accurate answer—all in one go.

## Next Challenge: Context Window Limitation

One of the challenges with LLMs is the context window limitation. RAGs address this issue by retrieving only the most relevant sections of the documents based on the user prompt, avoiding the need to process entire documents within the model's context.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Improved Accuracy and Relevance**: By leveraging external data sources, RAG systems produce responses that are more precise and pertinent to user queries.
- **Mitigation of AI Hallucinations**: RAG reduces instances where AI models generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information by grounding responses in factual data.
- **Real-Time Information Access**: RAG enables models to provide answers based on the most current data, which is particularly beneficial in rapidly changing fields.

## Challenges in Implementing RAG

- **Data Quality Assurance**: Ensuring the external data sources are accurate and reliable is crucial for the effectiveness of RAG systems.
- **System Complexity**: Integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models adds complexity to the system architecture, requiring careful design and maintenance.
- **Latency Concerns**: Retrieving and processing external information can introduce delays, affecting the responsiveness of the system.

## Applications of RAG

- **Customer Service**: Enhancing chatbots to provide accurate and context-specific responses by accessing up-to-date information.
- **Healthcare**: Assisting medical professionals by retrieving the latest research and clinical guidelines to support decision-making.
- **Legal Research**: Aiding legal professionals in accessing relevant case laws and statutes efficiently.
